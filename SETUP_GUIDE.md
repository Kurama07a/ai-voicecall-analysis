## Testing the API

Once you've added your API key:

1. Upload a sample audio file (.mp3 or .wav)
2. Click "Process Recording"
3. Wait for transcription and analysis (usually 5-15 seconds)
4. View the detailed results!

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "GROQ_API_KEY not configured"**
- Make sure you created `.env.local` in the root directory
- Check that you pasted the full API key (starts with `gsk_`)
- Restart the dev server after adding the key

**Error: "Failed to process audio"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the audio file is .mp3 or .wav format
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted or too large (< 25MB recommended)
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

**Transcription is empty**
- Make sure the audio file contains clear speech
- Check that the audio isn't muted or silent
- Try a different audio file

## Sample Test Files

You can test with any call recording, or record a sample conversation. The system works best with:
- Clear audio quality
- English language (Whisper supports 99+ languages though!)
- Call duration: 30 seconds to 10 minutes
- File size: < 25MB

## Need Help?

- Check the main README.md for full documentation
- Review the evaluation parameters in `lib/evaluation-params.ts`
- Look at the API implementation in `app/api/analyze-call/route.ts`
